Many great Street Foods can be found all across North America. My app will give your recipes for Canadian Poutine, Texas Tommy Hot Dogs, and Canadian Mapple Taffy (Tire Sur La Neige).

Poutine is a wonderful and delicious concoction of fries, gravy and cheese curds and is one of the most quintessential Canadian dishes! If you are an English speaking Canadian, you'll almost certainly pronounce it "poo-teen" (emphasis on the last syllable). French Canadians might suggest that it should be pronounced as "poo-tin" (again, with the emphasis on the last syllable).

Texas Tommy is a Pennsylvanian variety of a hot dog, consisting of a toasted bun filled with a split and grilled or fried hot dog sausage, crispy slices of bacon, and heaps of cheese. The earliest versions had sausages that were wrapped in bacon before being grilled, and it is suggested that Texas Tommy possible influenced the creation of Tijuana dogs.

Tire sur la neige (draw on the snow) is an old-fashioned treat in Québec, also known as tire d'érable or la tire. It is made in the late winter and early spring as the maple syrup harvest begins and snow is still on the ground.
