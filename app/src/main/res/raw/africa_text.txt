Many great Street Foods can be found all across Africa. My app will give your recipes for Chicken Chichinga (Ghanaian Chicken Kebabs), Yassa Chicken (Poulet au Yassa), and Kelewele (Spicy Fried Plantains).

Chicken chichinga are Ghanaian chicken kebabs made with suya spice, which is a peanut-based spice blend thatâ€™s widely used in Ghana and Nigeria. Chichinga can be made with any meat, tofu or vegetables. The meat versions of chichinga, particularly beef, are popular street foods in Ghana and Nigeria (where it is referred to as suya).

Yassa Chicken (Poulet au Yassa) is a French inspired meal that has been adapted by the Senegalese specifically in the Casamance region of Senegal. If you love onions you will love this onion extravaganza of incredibly moist and flavorful Senegalese dish.

Kelewele is a flavorful Ghanaian dish consisting of deep-fried plantain chunks that are usually combined with salt, ginger, and hot peppers. It is usually served as an accompaniment to bean stews or rice dishes, although kelewele is also often sold by numerous African street vendors as a dessert.
