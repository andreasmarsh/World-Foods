Chicken Chichinga (Ghanaian Chicken Kebabs)


Makes 5 kebabs
Time: 1 hr

Ingredients:

3 large boneless, skinless chicken breasts (chopped into 1 inch cubes; about 30 pieces)
2½ tbsp suya spice
3 tbsp tomato paste
1 tsp garlic (minced)
1 tsp ginger (minced)
1 tsp salt
1 tsp black pepper
1 tbsp canola oil


Directions:

1. Combine the tomato paste, suya spice, canola oil, garlic, and ginger in a large bowl. Use a spoon to mix the ingredients together to make a marinade.
2. Sprinkle the salt and pepper onto the chicken and place the chicken into the bowl with the marinade. Use a spoon to coat all the sides of each chicken bite with the marinade. Place the marinated chicken in the fridge for 30 minutes.
3. If you’re using wooden skewers, place them in a bowl with warm water for 30 minutes to prevent the skewers from burning when you’re grilling the chichinga.
4. Remove the skewers from the bowl and thread each chicken piece onto the skewers (I threaded about 6 pieces of chicken onto each skewer) and set aside on a clean plate.
5. If you’re using a grill, place the chichinga on the grill and grill each side until the chicken is cooked through and browned on each side (about 10-15 minutes).
6. If you don’t have a grill, oil and heat a grilling pan on the stove. Place the chichinga on the grilling pan and make grill marks on each side (about 5 minutes for each side).
7. Transfer the grilling pan with the chichinga to a preheated oven (set on low broil). Broil the chichinga in the oven for 8 minutes. Turn each skewer and broil the chichinga on the new side for another 8 minutes. The internal temperature for each chicken bite should be 165°F.
8. Enjoy!
