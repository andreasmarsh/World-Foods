Texas Tommy Hot Dogs


Serves: 4
Time: 30 mins

Ingredients:

8 Hot dogs
4 slices Cheddar Cheese
8 slices Bacon
8 Hot dog buns, split


Directions:

1.  Heat gas or charcoal grill. Cut length wise slit in each hot dog, cutting almost but not quite to other side. Cut each cheese slice into 4 strips; insert strips into openings in hot dogs.
2.  Wrap each hot dog with slice of bacon; secure with toothpicks.
3.  Place hot dogs on grill over medium heat. Cook about 10 minutes, turning often, until bacon is cooked. Add buns, cut sides down, to grill for last 1 to 2 minutes or until toasted.
4.  For Deep-Fried Fries: Prepare your potatoes and cut into 1/2-inch thick sticks. Place into a large bowl and cover completely with cold water. Allow to stand at least one hour or several hours. When ready to cook, heat your oil in your deep fryer or large, wide, heavy cooking pot to 300Â° F.
5.  Place hot dogs in toasted buns. Serve immediately.
6.  Enjoy!
